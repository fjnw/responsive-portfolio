		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<hr>

		<p>Welcome to my homework portfolio page. I'm typing this against my will for fear of losing points on this assignment. Actually, I'd like to share with you a story of how I earned the only <del>degree</del> associates degree that I have.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After attending community college part-time on and off over the span of 5 years I earned quite a number of credits, over 100 credit hours if I'm not mistaken. Due to poor planning I had earned many credits in certain disiplines but too few in others so I did not fullfil the requirement to earn an associates degree. A year ago, or over a year since I had last taken a course at that school, I received a suspicious package from that community college. In it contained a diploma for an Associates Degree with my name prompting a flashback from my guidance counselor clearly telling me which disciplines I was short credit hours for a degree. The letter inside the dipolma cover stated that they had done an audit of many of their students and discovered I was  elgible for a degree. I suspect they had changed their policy on some of the courses I had taken to make them elgible for more disciplines but I didn't question it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>More surprising was that in addition to this package was an envelope mailed to me again from my school. It contained a check for $5.00... adressed to me, from the school. I didn't question this, either. Not many can say they earned a degree without knowing it. Even fewer can say they earned a degree with the school giving them money.</p>
